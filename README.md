# Hi there 👋, I am Uzair!
_IoT, Robotics, ML, & AWS Cloud Engineer_

I recently graduated from the University of Hong Kong with a major in engineering.  
I'm a tech enthusiast and an aspiring gym rat, always on the lookout for the latest and greatest in the tech world.  
Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Software developer for IoT devices, and I'm also working on my own projects to master low-latency engineering.

If you want to chat about anything from IoT to Cloud Development, Machine Learning, and Robotics, feel free to drop me a message!  
If you're not into tech, we can always talk about soccer! I'm all ears for any ideas you want me to join or just to have a lively chat. Drop me a message anytime!
